# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-2

PROJECT 1:
This project has been developed to address the recent problem, which has been faced during COVID-19 pandemic period by the Financial service providers at their ATM stations. 
The model has been developed by utilizing the deep tranfer learning model called ResNet50 which has been trained with around 5k faces with and without mask, augmented at different angles for training the model. 

#Programming Language: Python
#Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Scikit.metrics, Pandas. 

PROJECT 2:
This part of the project has two sections, first part of this is proposal of multilayer object detection using complex Gated-CNN appraoch, which could help the model to detect the object, on the second layer on the image frame, even if they are obstructed by other objects in the first layer. This part of the report also address the scalability issue for the practical implementations of the project. Second, part of the report critically reviews the paper 'AUTOENCODER NODE SALIENCY - SELECTING RELEVANT LATENT REPRESENTATIONS'.
